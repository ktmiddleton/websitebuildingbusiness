Step 1)

Download Node.js runtime (This is really all you need)

Link for download: (Make sure the version you are downloading matches your operating system)
https://nodejs.org/en/download

Once downloaded, follow the setup wizard through until the end. 
There are no special configurations needed, so whatever is recommended by default is okay.

Step 2)
You will need to open this folder in VSCode, ensure you open the parent folder "WebsiteBuildingBusiness"

Once the folder is open in VSCode and you have successfully installed Node.js, go ahead and open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS)
From there, you need to navigate into the folder directory. The easiest way to do this is locate it in your file browser - and then use the 'cd' command to switch folders until you get to the right one.

Example:

I downloaded "WebsiteBuildingBusiness" to this directory: 

"C:\Users\Kobe Middleton\dev2\websitebuildingbusiness"

When I open Command Prompt, it starts me in Kobe Middleton. Therefore, I need to navigate to 'dev2', and then to 'websitebuildingbusiness'.

Please watch the video for a more detailed explanation on this. 

In the example listed above, I would type 'cd dev2' and then 'cd websitebuildingbusiness' and then 'cd project-1' one last time until I am in the proper directory.

Step 3)
Once in the right directory with Command Prompt or Teminal, you can then run the following commands:

npm install react-scripts

npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion

npm install react-responsive-carousel

npm start

If there is an error, it may be that there is an extra package that is not installed. 
If it says "_____ does not exist" all you need to do is look up the package name and use npm install with the name to install it.
